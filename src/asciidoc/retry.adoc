Sometimes it is required to retry a failed test. This can be achieved by setting the system properties +junit.retry.tests+ to true and +max.retries+ to the number of times you want failed tests to be retried. If +max.retries+ provided and +junit.retry.tests+=true, all method tests will be executed until first successful run, but not more than 1 + +max.retries+ times.
