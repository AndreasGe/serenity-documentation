Serenity BDD allows create links between stories/tests and issues. Sometimes it is useful for complex development workflow, and for organizing self-documented tests.

Configuration of links made by annotations.Generally in annotations you should use name of issues according to mask #(NAME)(-)(NUMBER), link will be created to (NAME)(-)(NUMBER),for example if you will use #MP-14, you will find link to http./../905, if you will use #905 you will find link to http./../905 and so on.

For such configuration with JUnit you can you can use annotations `@Issue`, `@Issues`, `@Title`.




More information about `@Title` can be find under <<Human-readable method titles>>.


You can also use the `@issue` annotation to link scenarios with issues when using JBehave, as illustrated here:
[source,gherkin]
----
Meta:
@issue #MYPROJ-1, #MYPROJ-2

Scenario: A scenario that works
Meta:
@issues #MYPROJ-3,#MYPROJ-4
@issue #MYPROJ-5

Given I have an implemented JBehave scenario
And the scenario works
When I run the scenario
Then I should get a successful result
