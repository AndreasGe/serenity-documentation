By default, Serenity saves a screenshot for every step executed during the tests. Serenity can be configured to control when screenshots are stored.

=== Configuring when screenshots are taken
The property +serenity.take.screenshots+ can be set to configure how often the screenshots are taken. This property can take the following values:

+FOR_EACH_ACTION+:: Saves a screenshot at every web element action (like click(), typeAndEnter(), type(), typeAndTab() etc.).

+BEFORE_AND_AFTER_EACH_STEP+:: Saves a screeshot before and asfter every step.

+AFTER_EACH_STEP+:: Saves a screenshot after every step

+FOR_FAILURES+:: Saves screenshots only for failing steps. This can save disk space and speed up the tests a little. It is very useful for data-driven testing.

=== Using annotations to control screenshots
An even more granular level of control is possible using annotations. You can annotate any test or step method (or any method used by a step or test) with the +@Screenshots+ annotation to override the number of screenshots taken within this step (or sub-step). Some sample uses are shown here:

------------------
@Step
@Screenshots(onlyOnFailures=true)
public void screenshots_will_only_be_taken_for_failures_from_here_on() {…}

@Test
@Screenshots(forEachStep=true)
public void should_take_screenshots_for_each_step_in_this_test() {…}

@Test
@Screenshots(forEachAction=true)
public void should_take_screenshots_for_each_action_in_this_test() {…}
------------------


=== Taking screenshots at any arbitrary point during a step
It is possible to have even finer control on capturing screenshots in the tests. Using the +takeScreenshot+ method, you can  instruct Serenity to take a screenshot at any arbitrary point in the step irrespective of the screenshot level set using configuration or annotations.

Simply call +Serenity.takeScreenshot()+ in the step methods whenever you want a screenshot to be captured.


=== Increasing the size of screenshots
Sometimes the default window size is too small to display all of the application screen in the screenshots. You can increase the size of the window Serenity opens by providing the +Serenity.browser.width+ and +Serenity.browser.height+ system properties. For example, to use a browser window with dimensions of 1200x1024, you could do the following:

------------------
$ mvn clean verify -Dserenity.browser.width=1200 -DSerenity.browser.height=1024
------------------

Typically, the width parameter is the only one you will need to specify, as the height will be determined by the contents of the browser page.

If you are running Serenity with JUnit, you can also specify this parameter (and any of the others, for that matter) directly in your pom.xml file, in the maven-surefire-plugin configuration, e.g:


------------------
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>2.7.1</version>
            <configuration>
                <argLine>-Xmx1024m</argLine>
                <systemPropertyVariables>
                    <serenity.browser.width>1200</serenity.browser.width>
                </systemPropertyVariables>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
        ...
------------------

When the browser width is larger than 1000px, the slideshow view in the reports will expand to show the full screenshots.

Note there are some caveats with this feature. In particular, it will not work at all with Chrome, as Chrome, by design, does not support window resizing. In addition, since WebDriver uses a real browser, so the maximum size will be limited by the physical size of the browser. This limitation applies to the browser width, as the full vertical length of the screen will still be recorded in the screenshot even if it scrolls beyond a single page.

==== Screenshots and OutOfMemoryError issues
Selenium needs memory to take screenshots, particularly if the screens are large. If Selenium runs out of memory when taking screenshots, it will log an error in the test output. In this case, configure the maven-surefire-plugin to use more memory, as illustrated here:

------------------
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.7.1</version>
    <configuration>
        <argLine>-Xmx1024m</argLine>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
------------------

=== Saving raw screenshots
Serenity saves only rescaled screenshots by default. This is done to help reduce the disk space taken by reports. If you require to save the original unscaled screenshots, this default can be easily overridden by setting the property, +serenity.keep.unscaled.screenshots+ to +true+.

=== Saving HTML source files for screenshots
It is possible to save html source files for the screenshots by setting the property, +serenity.store.html.source+ to +true+. Html source files are not saved by default to conserve disk space.

=== Blurring sensitive screenshots
For security/privacy reasons, it may be required to blur sensitive screenshots in Serenity reports. This can be done by annotating the test methods or steps with the annotation +@BlurScreenshots+. When defined on a test, all screenshots for that test will be blurred. When defined on a step, only the screenshot for that step will be blurred. @BlurredScreenshot takes a string parameter with values +LIGHT, MEDIUM+ or +HEAVY+ to indicate the amount of blurring. For example,

------------------
@Test
@BlurScreenshots("HEAVY")
public void looking_up_the_definition_of_pineapple_should_display_the_corresponding_article() {
    endUser.is_the_home_page();
    endUser.looks_for("pineapple");
    endUser.should_see_definition_containing_words("A thorny fruit");
}
------------------
