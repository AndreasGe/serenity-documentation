== Introducing Serenity

image::serenity-logo.png[]

Serenity BDD is a tool that aims to make the idea of "living documentation" (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_by_example) a reality.

Serenity BDD helps you write clean, maintainable http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development[BDD]-style automated http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_testing[functional] acceptance and regression tests at a faster pace. It provides features that make it easier to organize and structure your automation tests, associating them with the user stories or features that they test. As the tests are executed, Serenity BDD generates illustrated documentation; describing how the AUT (Application Under Test) is used based on the stories described by the tests. The main advantage of using Serenity BDD is that you do not have to invest time in building your own automation framework and maintaining it.

Serenity BDD provides strong support for automated web tests using http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver[Selenium 2], though it also works very effectively for non-web tests such as tests that exercise web services or even call application code directly.
          
The aim of Serenity is to make it easy to quickly write well-structured, maintainable automated acceptance criteria. You can work with Behavior-Driven-Development tools like Cucumber or JBehave, or simply use JUnit. You can integrate with requirements stored in an external source (such as JIRA or any other test cases mangement tool), or just use a simple directory-based approach to organize your requirements.

Up until November 2014, Serenity went by the name of Thucydides.
