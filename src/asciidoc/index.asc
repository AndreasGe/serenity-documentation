[[introduction]]
== Introducing Serenity

Serenity is a tool that aims to make the idea of "living documentation" a reality.

Serenity can help you write clean, maintainable BDD-style automated acceptance and regression tests easier. It provides features that make it easier to organize and structure your acceptance tests, associating them with the user stories or features that they test. As the tests are executed, Serenity generates illustrated documentation describing how the application is used based on the stories described by the tests. 

Serenity provides strong support for automated web tests based on Selenium 2 ( http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/ ), though it also works very effectively for non-web tests.
          
Serenity tries not to force you to change your tool set too much: you can work with Behavior-Driven-Development tools like Cucumber or JBehave, or simply use JUnit. You can integrate with requirements stored in an external source (such as JIRA), or just use a simple directory-based approach to organize your requirements.

Up until November 2014, Serenity went by the name of Thucydides.
